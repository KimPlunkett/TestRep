Title: Prime Saliency in Semantic Priming with 18-Month-Olds  
Cognition  
  
Dear Professor Kim Plunkett,  
  
Reviewers' comments on your work have now been received. They are attached below.

As you will see, all three Reviewers, whom I thank for their highly valuable comments on the manuscript, see merit in the reported work. In particular, they applaud the methodological soundness of the study as well as to the clarity of the manuscript (although some additional clarifications may be in order in a few places), and I agree.

However, I also concur with one of the Reviewers who raises the issue of the broader impact and relevance of the study beyond the specific field of word learning / lexical organization. This is a very important point, as Cognition has a broad readership.

In addition to addressing the more detailed comments raised by the Reviewers, I would like to invite you to revise the manuscript to make its contribution more relevant for Cognition. The final decision will hinge on whether this broader relevance can be made more apparent.

Best regards,

Judit

## Reviewers' comments:  
  
  
  
### Reviewer #1: 
The current study investigated semantic priming 18 month old infants using the inter-modal priming technique. The main focus was on the effect of prime repetition on the magnitude of priming. The results showed that prime repetition resulted in longer looking times at related than at unrelated target referents. In the "singular prime" condition, the prime-target SOA contributed to the magnitude (and the direction) of priming.  
  
Participants' primary language was reported to be British-English. It remains unclear whether the participants were also exposed to another language or languages and how much input their received in each of their languages. The lexical-semantic system has shown to emerge a few months later in bilingual than in monolingual infants.  

><span style="color:red;"> Kim: Not clear to me why R1 raises this issue, but we have to deal with it. @Nicola: Can you say something about the recruitment criteria. My recollection is that we only recruited monolinguals. Can you confirm. </span>
  
Please, indicate (in Appendix) which primes were also associatively related to the target. Also, from which data-set the associative pairs were chosen from? Primes were not repeated cross trials, and each pairing was presented once in the four conditions. This means that a certain pair was always in a certain condition (e.g., a certain prime-target pair only in 1st presentation condition)? Did you randomize the pairs between subjects?  

><span style="color:red;">Kim: Again, these seem like questions that Nicola is best placed to answer. </span>
  
The number of trials in "singular position prime" condition is very low, and the results show quite a lot of variation, especially in "position three" condition (Fig. 4). It makes me wonder how reliable the data is. If some of the extreme values were taken away from the data, the results would not most probably be significant. Authors could discuss the limitations that are due to a small number of data points.  
  
Results are partly hard to follow. One of the reason is that also marginally significant results are reported. Please, report only significant findings (see also, Discussion page 25, chapter "prime repetition"). Also, presenting the cluster-based permutation analyses on the left side of the Figures while describing these results after the GCA in the text makes the work harder for the reader. A small detail: presenting the titles below the figures (e.g., (a) looking proportion: first position) is also slightly confusing for the reader.  
  
The significant time-windows in the permutation analyses are very short-lived. Are these typical windows when using these types of analyses? Interestingly, the early priming effect - greater looking times for related targets - is more long-lasting. I am wondering whether this early effect is related to so-called "congruence" effect that has been earlier reported in infant ERP studies? (see, Friedrich, & Friederici, (2005). Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 17(11), 1785-1802).  
  
The authors conclude that priming effect is stronger in the "repeated condition" due to enhanced prime saliency through repetition. What exactly does the saliency mean here? Semantic satiation studies have demonstrated a subjective experience of loss of meaning of a word as a result of repetition of that word. I am aware that this explanation is not suitable to explain the current results, but the manuscript could benefit from additional explanations for enhanced priming effect in repeated versus singular condition.

Reviewer #2: I believe this paper is well-written and presents a well-designed study. It makes an important contribution to the literature by providing further evidence of the existence of a structured semantic system that is already functional at 18 months of age. I believe this manuscript would be of great interest to the readership of Cognition. Overall, I am pleased with its current form; I just have a couple of minor comments:  
  
* In the Methods section, it is mentioned that all participants had British English as their primary language. Could you please clarify whether the participants had any exposure to other language(s) and provide details if applicable?  
  
* I suggest changing the colours in Figure 4 as they are difficult to distinguish when the paper is printed in black and white.  
  
* The conclusion does not read like a typical conclusion; rather, it appears more like a summary of the findings. I recommend revising it to better reflect a conclusive summary.  
  
* On a related note, the methodological contribution of this paper is only mentioned in the conclusion. I believe this is an important point that deserves to be discussed in the main discussion section instead.  
  
  
  
Reviewer #3: The focus of the paper is on the methodological factors that influence whether 18-month-old infants exhibit semantic priming between related words. The investigation is motivated by the fact that semantic priming is a tool for exploring the development of a semantically interconnected lexicon. The researchers manipulated whether semantically related versus unrelated primes were repeated or presented repeatedly or singly, and when presented singly, the time elapsed between the prime and target. The researchers assessed multiple outcome variables derived from looking behavior using multiple analyses.  
  
I found the paper to be clearly written, the study design to be well-motivated, and the analysis approach thorough (though with some concerns that I highlight below). My primary source of uncertainty is whether the topic of infant semantic priming methods is sufficiently impactful/of sufficiently broad interest for the readership of Cognition. I expect that the paper will be satisfying to researchers who study infant semantic development, as it may help with interpreting prior studies and designing new ones on this particular topic. Therefore, I hope the paper can be published in a sufficiently high-visibility venue for the relevant audience to find it. However, I have doubts about whether it will have appeal beyond researchers studying infant semantic development.  
  
Aside from the concern about the breadth of appeal, I have some concerns with the analyses and conceptual point.  
  
Analysis concerns:  
First, there have been issues raised with growth curve analysis, e.g., in Huang & Snedeker 2020 and McMurray 2023. In light of these, is GCA appropriate here?  
  
Related to the concerns with growth curve analysis - the results of the time-course analyses for the different SOAs are pretty complex (e.g., effects that appear, disappear, then reappear). This raises the concern that analyses might spuriously pick up on noise, e.g., random fluctuations across infants. To what extent to the patterns reported actually characterize the looking patterns of individual infants?  
  
Finally, given that the effect for primes presented singly appears to flip SOA decreases, I think it may not be meaningful to interpret what happens when the prime is presented singly while collapsing over SOA.  
  
Conceptual point:  
The Introduction indicates that a priming effect between semantically related words like "cat" and "dog" means that the prime activated the taxonomic category (e.g., "animals") to which both words belong. Similarly, much of the Mechanisms of Priming subsection in the Discussion makes this assumption. However, there are other potential sources for this priming effect, such as that the words co-occur and/or occur in similar contexts (e.g., see Unger, Yim, Savic, Dennis & Sloutsky, 2023). The source of the effect seems largely tangential to the paper, so I suggest the paper avoid making such commitments.
